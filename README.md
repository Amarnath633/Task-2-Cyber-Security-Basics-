# Cyber Security Internship – Task 2

## Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux & Windows)

### Objective
To understand operating system–level security concepts including user management, permissions, services, firewalls, and OS hardening techniques in Linux and Windows environments.

---

### Concepts Covered

#### User Accounts & Privileges
Operating systems use user accounts to control access. Administrative users have full privileges, while standard users have restricted access to minimize security risks.

---

#### Linux File Permissions
Linux file permissions define read, write, and execute access for owner, group, and others.
Commands used:
- `ls -l` – view permissions
- `chmod` – modify permissions
- `chown` – change ownership

---

#### Administrator vs Standard User
- **Administrator / Root:** Full system control
- **Standard User:** Limited permissions for safety

Using standard users helps prevent accidental or malicious system changes.

---

#### Firewall Configuration
- **Linux:** UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- **Windows:** Windows Defender Firewall

Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing network traffic to prevent unauthorized access.

---

#### Processes & Services
Running processes and services should be monitored regularly. Unnecessary services should be disabled to reduce the system attack surface.

---

#### OS Hardening Practices
- Apply least privilege principle
- Keep system updated with patches
- Enable firewall
- Disable unused services
- Use strong authentication

---

### Outcome
This task provided practical understanding of OS-level security controls and hardening techniques, which are critical for system administration and cyber defense roles.
